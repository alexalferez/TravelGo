# Travel Go
## Intro
TravelGo is a web application dedicated to finding and sharing expereinces. Users can inspiration for travel, adventures, weekend getaways, and cool city spots. Log in and add a recommendation, or check out other users' recommendations for four main cities on the West Coast of the United States. 

## Background
This project was built by [James Kim][1], [Alex Alferez][2], and [Thom Strub][3] - three West Coast USA devs who love finding new experiences. The internet has plenty of travel sites, but most are review based and offer a complex UI. TravelGo's strenth is its focus on one thing- sharing experiences so they can help people find something cool to do quickly. 

The UI is centered around providing users with the ability to find inspiration for a last minute trip or help others do the same. It featues:  
- user-generated ideas
- minimalist UI to focus on the recommendations from the users
- comments from other users to offer more insight or detail for a recommendation
- photos uploaded by users to show off their recommendations
- search by location for those who know where they want to search
