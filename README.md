# Travel Go
## Intro
Social app for finding inspiration for travel, adventures, weekend getaways, and cool city spots. Log in and add a recommendation, or check out other users' recommendations for four main cities on the West Coast of the United States.

## Background
This project was built by [James Kim][1], [Alex Alferez][2], and [Thom Strub][3] to provide a dedicated site for user-based recommendations.  

The UI is centered around providing users with the ability to find inspiration for a last minute trip or help others do the same. It featues:
